# Welcome!

My name is [Michal Malyska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malyskamichal/)  and I
will be hosting the majority of my work here; these
include: teaching materials, personal projects, and research.

\newline

Most of the presented work will be related to data analysis, and research
projects that I am involved with. The teaching resources available here are in
regards to the tutorials that I run and are organized by class.
