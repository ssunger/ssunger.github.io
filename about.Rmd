I'm currently a Masters student in Statistics at the University of Toronto.
My BSc was a specialist degree in statistics (also from UofT)
which is essentially a double major in applied
statistics and theoretical statistics. I am a research assistant at RiskLab,
and a teaching assistant in the deparment of statistical sciences. 

My research interests are split between the application of Machine Learning to 
finance (hence my work at RiskLab), and MCMC methods, focusing on convergence
rates and computational efficiency. 

In the past I've worked at Intact Financial on the Belairdirect team,
and at Deloitte Canada on the Actuarial, Rewards & Analytics team, focusing
on analytics and predictive modelling.
